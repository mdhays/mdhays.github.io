        <p class="about"> Hi, I'm Matthew. I'm a full stack  software developer living in Nashville looking to start my career. I grew up loving video games, computers, and music, so I was drawn to technology and the internet from a very young age. I never imagined that one day I'd learn to design a webpage, build a game, or create a server. However, in 2015 I heard about a coding bootcamp called Nashville Software School. </p>
        <p class="about"> I decided to leave behind my life in Illinois to make the move down south to attend NSS. I feel it's one of the best decisions I've ever made, and I'm confident that I'll continue to learn and love software development. </p>
